        <p>UAVs are aircraft that are guided autonomously, by remote control, or by both means and that carry some combination of sensors, electronic receivers and transmitters, and offensive ordnance. They are used for strategic and operational reconnaissance and for battlefield surveillance, and they can also intervene on the battlefield—either indirectly, by designating targets for precision-guided munitions dropped or fired from manned systems, or directly, by dropping or firing these munitions themselves.</p>
        <p>The earliest UAVs were known as remotely piloted vehicles or drones. Drones were small controlled aircraft first used during World War II as for fighters and antiaircraft guns. They fell into two categories: small, inexpensive, and often expendable vehicles used for training; and, from the 1950s, larger and more sophisticated systems recovered by radio-controlled landing or parachute. The vehicles were typically fitted with reflectors to simulate the radar return of enemy aircraft, and it soon occurred to planners that they might also be used as decoys to help bombers penetrate enemy defenses. (High-performance drones are still developed—for example, to test systems designed to shoot down antiship cruise missiles.)</p>

    <h2>Military Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)</h2>
    <p style="font-size:20px;">The U.S. military began experimenting with unmanned aircraft as early as World War I. By World War II, unmanned craft could be controlled by radio signals, usually from another aircraft. Vehicles that could return from a mission and be recovered appeared in the late 1950s. Today, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) perform a wide range of missions and are used by all four branches of the military.

        This exhibit showcased six modern military UAVs that represented a variety of missions and technologies. They ranged from large vehicles that can carry offensive weapons to a miniature system whose components are light and compact enough to be carried in a Marine’s backpack.</p>

              <p>The advantages of strategic UAVs notwithstanding, the emergent technologies described above were first exploited in war by Israeli battlefield UAVs. The first of these was the Tadiran Mastiff, a twin-boom aircraft introduced in 1975 that resembled a large model airplane weighing just over 90 kg (200 pounds) with a boxy fuselage and a pusher propeller driven by a small piston engine. It could be catapulted from a truck-mounted ramp, launched by rocket booster, or operated from a runway. The Mastiff and the larger but similar Scout, produced by Israeli Aircraft Industries (IAI), proved effective in identifying and locating surface-to-air missiles and marking them for destruction during hostilities in Lebanon in 1982. The U.S. Marine Corps procured the Mastiff, and it followed up this vehicle with the IAI-designed and U.S.-built RQ-2 Pioneer, a slightly larger vehicle with secure up- and downlink. The Pioneer, fielded in 1986, was used by the Marine Corps and Navy in the Persian Gulf War of 1990–91. Meanwhile, the U.S. Army promoted the development of a similar but still larger UAV, the Israeli-designed RQ-5 Hunter, which had a gross weight of 1,600 pounds (720 kg) and was propelled by both pusher and tractor propellers. Although not procured in quantity, Hunters served in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.</p>

    <h2>Reaper drone aircraft</h2> 
    <p style="font-size:20px;">The turboprop-powered, multi-mission MQ-9A Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) was developed with GA-ASI funding and first flown in 2001. MQ-9A "Reaper" is a highly sophisticated development built on the experience gained with the company's battle-proven Predator RPA and is a major evolutionary leap forward in overall performance and reliability. MQ-9A was designated "Reaper" by the U.S. and Royal Air Force, but has become the widely used name for any Predator B equipped with weapons.

        Featuring unmatched operational flexibility, MQ-9A has an endurance of over 27 hours, speeds of 240 KTAS, can operate up to 50,000 feet, and has a 3,850 pound (1746 kilogram) payload capacity that includes 3,000 pounds (1361 kilograms) of external stores. The aircraft carries 500% more payload and has nine times the horsepower. It provides a long-endurance, persistent surveillance/strike capability for the war fighter.
        
        An extremely reliable aircraft, MQ-9A is equipped with a fault-tolerant flight control system and triple redundant avionics system architecture. It is engineered to meet and exceed manned aircraft reliability standards.
        
        MQ-9A is powered by the flight-certified and proven Honeywell TPE331-10 turboprop engine, integrated with Digital Electronic Engine Control (DEEC), which significantly improves engine performance and fuel efficiency, particularly at low altitudes.</p>

              <p>U.S President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi welcomed India’s plans to procure General Atomics MQ-9B High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) Unmanned Aerial vehicles (UAV), the joint statement issued last week after talks between the two leaders said. This sets the stage for the acquisition of 31 of these armed UAVs, 15 SeaGuardians for the Indian Navy and 16 SkyGuardians — eight each for the Indian Army and Air Force.
                What is the cost and the process to be followed?
                Giving more details on the nature of the purchase, the joint statement said that the MQ-9Bs, which will be assembled in India, will enhance the Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities of India’s armed forces across domains. “As part of this plan, General Atomics will also establish a Comprehensive Global Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facility in India in support of India’s long-term goals to boost indigenous defence capabilities.”
                The procurement process has commenced with the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) chaired by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh according the Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) on June 15, the first step in the process. The deal will be executed through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) route of the U.S. government and is expected to take a few months to be concluded.</p>
